# OpenCV Image Processing Projects

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various image processing techniques using OpenCV. The examples cover fundamental operations such as reading and displaying images, image blending, edge detection, morphological transformations, and more.

## Project Structure

Each notebook in this repository focuses on a specific OpenCV concept:

- **Blending_Image_opencv.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates how to blend two images using OpenCV.

- **Color_distribution.ipynb**  
  Visualizes color distributions in images, including histograms and color spaces.

- **Edge-OpenCV.ipynb**  
  Applies edge detection techniques like Canny edge detection.

- **Image .ipynb**  
  Basic image operations such as loading, displaying, and saving images.

- **MorphologicalTransformations.ipynb**  
  Covers morphological operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.

- **OpenCV_Image.ipynb**  
  Introduces basic image handling with OpenCV.

- **OpenCV_drawShapes.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates how to draw geometric shapes (lines, rectangles, circles) on images.

- **OpenCV_gridient.ipynb**  
  Explores image gradients using Sobel, Scharr, and Laplacian operators.

- **OpenCV_video.ipynb**  
  Shows how to capture and manipulate video using OpenCV.

- **Pyramid_Image_resize.ipynb**  
  Explains image pyramids and how to resize images at multiple scales.

- **contours_Image_opencv.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates how to find and draw contours in images.

- **image Histograms_OpenCV.ipynb**  
  Shows how to compute and visualize image histograms.
